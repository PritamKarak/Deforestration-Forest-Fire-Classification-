In the second week, I focused on understanding and applying various data visualization techniques to effectively represent the dataset. I explored different types of plots such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps to gain deeper insights into the patterns and relationships within the data. Additionally, I learned how to detect and handle outliers to improve data quality and ensure more accurate analysis. A key part of this week’s learning was the implementation of SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), which was used to address class imbalance in the dataset. This technique was particularly useful in improving the prediction performance of models for the Deforestation Detection project, where detecting minority class events (such as deforestation occurrences) is critical. Overall, these steps helped enhance the dataset’s quality and robustness for downstream machine learning tasks.
